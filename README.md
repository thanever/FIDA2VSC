FIDA2VSC: False Data Injection Attacks to Voltage-source Converters

FIDA2VSC is a free software toolbox for solving the false data injection attack model that aims at damaging the operating security of converters in VSC-HVDC systems. This software can is able to demonstrate the false data injection attack problem facing VSC-HVDC systems, and also analyse the impact of this kind of attack on the values of maximum normalized residual of state estimation in batch.
