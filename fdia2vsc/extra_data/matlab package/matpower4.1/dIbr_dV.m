function [dIf_dVa, dIf_dVm, dIt_dVa, dIt_dVm, If, It] = dIbr_dV(branch, Yf, Yt, V)
%DIBR_DV   Computes partial derivatives of branch currents w.r.t. voltage.
%   [DIF_DVA, DIF_DVM, DIT_DVA, DIT_DVM, IF, IT] = DIBR_DV(BRANCH, YF, YT, V)
%   returns four matrices containing partial derivatives of the complex
%   branch currents at "from" and "to" ends of each branch w.r.t voltage
%   magnitude and voltage angle respectively (for all buses). If YF is a
%   sparse matrix, the partial derivative matrices will be as well. Optionally
%   returns vectors containing the currents themselves. The following
%   explains the expressions used to form the matrices:
%
%   If = Yf * V;
%
%   Partials of V, Vf & If w.r.t. voltage angles
%       dV/dVa  = j * diag(V)
%       dVf/dVa = sparse(1:nl, f, j * V(f)) = j * sparse(1:nl, f, V(f))
%       dIf/dVa = Yf * dV/dVa = Yf * j * diag(V)
%
%   Partials of V, Vf & If w.r.t. voltage magnitudes
%       dV/dVm  = diag(V./abs(V))
%       dVf/dVm = sparse(1:nl, f, V(f)./abs(V(f))
%       dIf/dVm = Yf * dV/dVm = Yf * diag(V./abs(V))
%
%   Derivations for "to" bus are similar.
%
%   Example:
%       [Ybus, Yf, Yt] = makeYbus(baseMVA, bus, branch);
%       [dIf_dVa, dIf_dVm, dIt_dVa, dIt_dVm, If, It] = ...
%           dIbr_dV(branch, Yf, Yt, V);
