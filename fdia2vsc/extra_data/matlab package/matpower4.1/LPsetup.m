%LPSETUP  Solves a LP problem using a callable LP routine.
%   [X, DUALS, IDX_WORKC, IDX_BINDC] = ...
%       LPSETUP(A, F, B, NEQUS, VLB, VUB, IDX_WORKC, MPOPT)
%
%   The LP problem is defined as follows:
%
%   min     f' * x
%   S.T.    a * x =< b
%           vlb =< x =< vub
%
%   All of the equality constraints must appear before inequality constraints.
%   NEQUS specifies how many of the constraints are equality constraints.
%
%   The algorithm (set in MPOPT) can be set to the following options:
%
%   320 - solve LP using ICS (equality constraints are eliminated)
%   340 - solve LP using Iterative Constraint Search (ICS)
%         (equality constraints are preserved, typically superior to 320 & 360)
%   360 - solve LP with full set of constraints
%
%   See also LPOPF_SOLVER.
