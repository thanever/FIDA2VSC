%MAKEAVL Construct linear constraints for constant power factor var loads.
%   [AVL, LVL, UVL, IVL]  = MAKEAVL(BASEMVA, GEN)
%
%   Constructs parameters for the following linear constraint enforcing a
%   constant power factor constraint for dispatchable loads.
%
%        LVL <= AVL * [Pg; Qg] <= UVL
%
%   IVL is the vector of indices of generators representing variable loads.
%
%   Example:
%       [Avl, lvl, uvl, ivl]  = makeAvl(baseMVA, gen);
