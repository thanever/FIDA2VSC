function rv = mipsver(varargin)
%MIPSVER  Prints or returns MIPS version info for current installation.
%   V = MIPSVER returns the current MIPS version number.
%   V = MIPSVER('all') returns a struct with the fields Name, Version,
%   Release and Date (all strings). Calling MIPSVER without assigning the
%   return value prints the version and release date of the current
%   installation of MIPS.
