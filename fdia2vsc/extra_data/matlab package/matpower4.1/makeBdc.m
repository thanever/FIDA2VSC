function [Bbus, Bf, Pbusinj, Pfinj] = makeBdc(baseMVA, bus, branch)
%MAKEBDC   Builds the B matrices and phase shift injections for DC power flow.
%   [BBUS, BF, PBUSINJ, PFINJ] = MAKEBDC(BASEMVA, BUS, BRANCH) returns the
%   B matrices and phase shift injection vectors needed for a DC power flow.
%   The bus real power injections are related to bus voltage angles by
%       P = BBUS * Va + PBUSINJ
%   The real power flows at the from end the lines are related to the bus
%   voltage angles by
%       Pf = BF * Va + PFINJ
%   Does appropriate conversions to p.u.
%
%   Example:
%       [Bbus, Bf, Pbusinj, Pfinj] = makeBdc(baseMVA, bus, branch);
