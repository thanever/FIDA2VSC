 INTRODUCTION
--------------

MATPOWER is a package of MATLAB(R) M-files for solving power flow and
optimal power flow problems. It is intended as a simulation tool for
researchers and educators that is easy to use and modify. MATPOWER
is designed to give the best performance possible while keeping the code
simple to understand and modify. It was initially developed as part
of the PowerWeb project <http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/powerweb/>.

MATPOWER can be downloaded from the MATPOWER home page above.

 TERMS OF USE
--------------

Please see the LICENSE file for the details. But here is the summary:

- Beginning with version 4, the code in MATPOWER is distributed under
  the GNU General Public License (GPL) with an exception added to
  clarify our intention to allow MATPOWER to interface with MATLAB
  as well as any other MATLAB code or MEX-files a user may have
  installed, regardless of their licensing terms.

- MATPOWER is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
  WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.

- While not required by the terms of the license, we do request that
  publications derived from the use of MATPOWER explicitly acknowledge
  that fact by citing [1].

Note:  Versions prior to MATPOWER 4 use a different license.


-----------------
 GETTING STARTED
-----------------

System Requirements
-------------------
    - MATLAB(R) version 6.5 or later (available from The MathWorks, Inc.
      http://www.mathworks.com/), or
    - GNU Octave version 3.2 or later (free software available from
      http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

Installation
------------
1.  Follow the download instructions on the MATPOWER home page. You
    should end up with a file named matpowerXXX.zip, where XXX depends
    on the version of MATPOWER.

2.  Unzip the downloaded file. Move the resulting matpowerXXX directory
    to the location of your choice. These files should not need to be
    modified, so it is recommended that they be kept separate from your
    own code. Let $MATPOWER denote the path to this directory.

3.  Add the following directories to your MATLAB path:
      $MATPOWER   - core MATPOWER functions
      $MATPOWER/t - test scripts for MATPOWER
      (optional) subdirectories of $MATPOWER/extras -
            additional functionality and contributed code

4.  At the MATLAB prompt, type 'test_matpower' (without the quotes) to
    run the test suite and verify that MATPOWER is properly installed
    and functioning.

Running MATPOWER
----------------
To run a simple Newton power flow on the 9-bus system specified in the
file case9.m, with the default algorithm options, at the MATLAB prompt,
type:

    runpf('case9')

To load the 30-bus system data from case30.m, increase its real power
demand at bus 2 to 30 MW, then run an AC optimal power flow with
default options, type:

    define_constants;
    mpc = loadcase('case30');
    mpc.bus(2, PD) = 30;
    runopf(mpc);

By default, the results of the simulation are pretty-printed to the
screen, but the solution can also be optionally returned in a 'results'
struct. The following example shows how simple it is, after running a DC
OPF on the 118-bus system in case118.m, to access the final objective
function value, the real power output of generator 6 and the power flow
in branch 51.

    results = rundcopf('case118');
    final_objective = results.f;
    gen6_output     = results.gen(6, PG);
    branch51_flow   = results.branch(51, PF);

For additional info, see the User's Manual and the on-line help
documentation for the various MATPOWER functions. For example:
    help runpf
    help runopf
    help mpoption
    help caseformat


---------------------------
 WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 4.1
---------------------------

Below is a summary of the changes since version 4.0 of MATPOWER. See the
CHANGES file in the docs directory for all the gory details.

* New features:
  - More new high performance OPF solvers:
    - Support for the Knitro interior point optimizer for large scale
      non-linear optimization. Use OPF_ALG = 600 for to select Knitro
      to solve the AC OPF. Requires the Matlab Optimization Toolbox
      and a license for Knitro, available from http://www.ziena.com/.
      See 'help mpoption' for more Knitro options.
    - Support for Gurobi to solve LP and QP problems. Set option
      OPF_ALG_DC = 700 to use Gurobi to solve the DC OPF. Requires
      Gurobi (http://www.gurobi.com/) and the Gurobi MEX interface
      (http://www.convexoptimization.com/wikimization/index.php/Gurobi_mex).
      See 'help mpoption' for more Gurobi options.
    - Updated for compatibility with CPLEX 12.3.
    - Changed options so that FMINCON uses its interior-point
      solver by default. Much faster on larger systems.
  - Support for basic modeling of DC transmission lines.
  - New case files with more recent versions of Polish system.
  - Power flow can handle networks with islands.

* Bugs fixed:
  - Computation of quadratic user-defined costs had a potentially
    fatal error. Thanks to Stefanos Delikaraoglou for find this.
  - Calculation of reserve prices in toggle_reserves() had an error.

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
  - Optional packages TSPOPF and MINOPF must be updated to latest
    versions.

 DOCUMENTATION
---------------

There are two primary sources of documentation for MATPOWER.
    - MATLAB's 'help' command
    - MATPOWER User's Manual

The User's Manual is included in the distribution (docs/manual.pdf) or
it can be downloaded separately from
http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/manual.pdf.

Each M-file has its own documentation which can be accessed by typing at
the MATLAB prompt:

    help <name of M-file>

Documentation for the case data file format can be found by typing:

    help caseformat

If something is still unclear after checking the manual and the help,
the source code *is* the documentation. ;-)
