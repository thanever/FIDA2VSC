%   MATPOWER is a package of MATLAB(R) M-files for solving power flow and
%   optimal power flow problems. It is intended as a simulation tool for
%   researchers and educators that is easy to use and modify. MATPOWER is
%   designed to give the best performance possible while keeping the code
%   simple to understand and modify. It was initially developed as part
%   of the PowerWeb project <http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/powerweb/>.
