function t_skip(cnt, msg)
%T_SKIP  Skips a number of tests.
%   T_SKIP(CNT, MSG) increments the global test count and skipped tests
%   count. Prints 'skipped tests x..y : ' followed by the MSG, unless the
%   global variable t_quiet is true. Intended to be called between calls to
%   T_BEGIN and T_END.
%
%   Example:
%       quiet = 0;
%       t_begin(5, quiet);
%       t_ok(pi > 3, 'size of pi');
%       t_skip(3, 'not yet written');
%       t_is(2+2, 4, 12, '2+2 still equals 4');
%       t_end;
%
%   See also T_OK, T_IS, T_BEGIN, T_END, T_RUN_TESTS.
